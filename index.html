jQuery
-------
$ sign is also called as bling 
use $("") instead of $('') in jquery [ $("button").addClass("animated bounce") ]
("animated shake") ("animated fadeOut") ("animated hinge")

jQuery has a css() function

jQuery has a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.
Here's how you would disable all buttons:
$("button").prop("disabled", true);

jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. 
Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.

jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags.
In other words, this function will not evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, but will instead treat it as the text you want to replace the existing content with.

jQuery has a function called .remove() that will remove an HTML element entirely

jQuery has a function called appendTo() that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element.

jQuery has a function called clone() that makes a copy of an element.
For example, if we wanted to copy target2 from our left-well to our right-well, we would use:
$("#target2").clone().appendTo("#right-well");

jQuery has a function called parent() that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you've selected.
Here's an example of how you would use the parent() function if you wanted to give the parent element of the left-well element a background color of blue:
$("#left-well").parent().css("background-color", "blue")

jQuery has a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.
Here's an example of how you would use the children() function to give the children of your left-well element the color of blue:
$("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue")

jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. target:nth-child(n) css selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type.
Here's how you would give the third element in each well the bounce class:
$(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");

Here's how you would target all the odd-numbered elements with class target and give them classes:
$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");

jQuery can target the body element as well.
Here's how we would make the entire body fade out: $("body").addClass("animated fadeOut");
